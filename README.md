# at-calc-1-0-0.cpp
`Hello, I am Arin Torney who has made a very simple calculator app using C++. You can calculate many things accurately up to a few decimal places up to a few decimal places. You will be able to add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiate and take a logarithm very easily even though this is nothing like database. This is just made of simple if...else statements but I hope you will enjoy this.`

_Thank You!_
